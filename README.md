# Aflac Consumer Sentiment & Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a capstone in collaboration with Aflac. We analyzed online consumer sentiment around the brand using text data scraped from Reddit. Our goal was to assess how public perception varied over time, using natural language processing and time series modeling to visualize and interpret sentiment trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, TextBlob)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Web Scraping (Selenium)
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for Visualization
- Tableau for time series 

## Key Features
- Scraped and cleaned over 1,000 Reddit comments mentioning Aflac.
- Handled noisy data including emojis, special characters, and filler words.
- Applied TextBlob for polarity and subjectivity sentiment scoring.
- Created a custom stopword list to better filter noise.
- Built a time series to track sentiment polarity over time.
- Generated sentiment word clouds to highlight term frequency and tone.

## How to Run
1. Open `Aflac_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
